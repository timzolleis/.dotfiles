description: TypeScript coding standards and design taste. Use when working on TypeScript code; when adding or changing domain models, modules, adapters, parsers, typed errors, async workflows, tests, TypeScript contracts, or Effect code; or when another engineering skill needs the user's coding standards.

# Coding Standards

Use these standards while designing and editing TypeScript. They encode the user's taste: correctness first, precise domain modeling, typed failures, deep modules, explicit boundaries, real-seam tests, strict TypeScript, and boring operational safety.

This skill is standalone. Load the topic files that match the code you are touching; do not treat the top-level summary as the whole standard.

## Core tenets

- Correctness, safety, debuggability, boundary integrity, and test integrity come before convenience.
- Local conventions matter when they are compatible with these standards.
- Parse boundary input before it reaches core logic; pass refined/domain values inward.
- Model invariants in types, constructors, parsers, and transitions.
- Model expected failures in typed channels; reserve throws for defects and boundary translation.
- Design deep modules with intentional seams, small interfaces, and explicit dependencies.
- Verify observable behavior through real seams.
- Keep TypeScript contracts strict, local, documented, and boring.
- Improve changed paths without forcing broad migrations unless explicitly requested.
- Do not design for backwards compatibility, migrations, rollout, backfill, dual-write/read paths, or deployment sequencing unless the user explicitly asks. Treat new designs as the desired target state, not a migration plan.

## Non-negotiables

These are not aesthetic preferences. When they conflict with existing code, preserve compatibility at the seam and improve the changed path rather than copying the violation.

- Untrusted, serialized, persisted, or framework-shaped input is parsed before core/service logic sees it.
- Decoded data is not trusted with `as SomeType`.
- Expected failures are visible in typed return channels, not hidden throws or rejected promises.
- Secrets do not enter errors, logs, traces, metrics, snapshots, or panic summaries.
- Raw platform bindings and framework types stay at composition seams or tightly local External Adapter Modules.
- Dependencies are explicit; hidden globals and ambient time/randomness/IDs do not drive service behavior.
- Tests prove observable behavior through module interfaces or real seams; module mocks and method spies are out.
- Type escape hatches are local, justified with `SAFETY:`, and hidden behind precise interfaces.
- Promises are owned: awaited, returned, collected, or handed to explicit detached-work machinery.
- Broad migrations require explicit user intent.
- Backwards compatibility, rollout, deployment sequencing, data backfills, and dual-write/read migration paths require explicit user intent; do not add them as default design concerns.

## How to apply the standards

1. **Audit the local codebase.** Before choosing a library, pattern, External Adapter Module shape, schema style, error representation, test strategy, observability mechanism, or module layout, inspect until the existing choice for each touched concern is identified or confirmed absent.
2. **Classify the change.** Identify the concerns touched: domain state, parsing, errors, observability, modules, async, tests, TypeScript contracts, or Effect.
3. **Load every relevant topic file.** The top-level summary is only the routing layer.
4. **Apply safety standards before local convention.** Follow established architecture where compatible. When local convention violates a non-negotiable, isolate compatibility at the boundary and improve the changed path.
5. **Prefer the smallest coherent improvement.** Do not start unrelated migrations, backwards-compatibility paths, rollout plans, backfill plans, or deployment sequencing. Do not add abstractions, External Adapter Modules, Service Modules, libraries, workflows, or config layers without a concrete reason.
6. **Verify through the right seam.** Tests should observe outcomes at the module or system interface that callers use.
7. **Name trade-offs.** If a standard cannot be fully applied without broad migration, state the compatibility constraint and the local improvement made.

## Strong defaults

Use the repository's established choice when it exists and satisfies these standards. When no established choice exists, load the topic file that owns the concern and follow its strong defaults.

Do not treat this root file as enough context for library, runtime, schema, error, testing, Effect, or toolchain choices.

## Rejected framings

- **"The existing code throws, so new expected failures can throw."** Preserve compatibility at boundaries; do not copy unsafe failure contracts into new local logic.
- **"Validation is enough."** Parsing must return the refined value and pass it inward.
- **"A wrapper is architecture."** A pass-through module earns its keep only when it hides complexity, owns policy, or translates across a real seam.
- **"Mocks make tests isolated."** Module mocks isolate the wrong thing. Replace behavior through real seams.
- **"Types are proof."** Serialized data, DB rows, and runtime-hop payloads become less structured at runtime. Parse them.
- **"Future flexibility justifies an interface."** A seam is real when behavior varies, a boundary translates, or tests substitute through an intentional seam.
- **"A lint suppression is a fix."** Suppressions must be targeted and explain the safety invariant.
