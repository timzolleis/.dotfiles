# Boundaries and Parsing

Every external, serialized, persisted, or framework-shaped value is less structured than your domain model. Parse at the seam, pass refined values inward, and project explicitly on the way out.

## Vocabulary

**Unknown Boundary Input** — Data from HTTP, RPC, queues, env vars, storage rows, JSON, third-party APIs, runtime hops, or framework objects before a parser establishes a precise type.

**External Adapter Module** — The module that translates between external/framework representations and service/domain values. It includes inbound protocol handlers and outbound persistence, runtime, SDK, platform, and third-party adapters.

**Persistence Boundary Parser** — A parser that reconstructs domain values from storage DTOs or rows and rejects contradictory persisted state.

**Protocol Projection** — A conversion from domain/service value to HTTP/RPC/queue/public API shape, owned by the protocol External Adapter Module.

**Persistence Projection** — A conversion between domain/service values and storage rows/records, owned by the persistence External Adapter Module.

## Non-negotiables

- Unknown boundary input stays `unknown` or boundary DTO-shaped until parsed.
- External input is parsed in the External Adapter Module, handler, composition entrypoint, or receiving runtime-hop handler before service/core code sees it; correct-by-construction values are passed inward.
- Decoded JSON, response bodies, env values, queue messages, storage JSON, and similar data are not cast into domain/service types.
- A successful parse returns the refined value; do not validate and then keep passing the unrefined input.
- Core/service code does not repeatedly downcast, shape-check, or defensively revalidate values already parsed, unless they crossed a new boundary.
- Storage/ORM rows are boundary input and are parsed before service logic sees them.
- Persisted representation selection fails closed: an unknown discriminator, version, or shape is rejected instead of entering a default or fallback variant.
- Runtime-hop payloads satisfy the transport serialization contract and are parsed/reconstructed on receipt.
- Protocol DTOs and persistence records are different projections; do not reuse one as the other by convenience.
- Environment/runtime config is parsed at startup or the earliest composition seam into typed config.

## Strong defaults

- Use the repository's established schema library when it satisfies the contract.
- In Effect codebases, use Effect Schema for refined values and codecs.
- Generic schema helpers should be Standard Schema compatible.
- If no schema convention exists outside Effect, prefer Zod 4.
- Mutating command/request object parsers reject unknown fields by default.
- Concrete parsers are named `parseX`.
- Smart constructors from already typed pieces are named `makeX` or `createX`.
- True predicates are named `isX`.
- Avoid `validateX` for functions that return refined values; they parse.

## Parse early

Parser failure shape follows the repository's error-handling convention. A parser may return a `Result`, throw inside a schema-library adapter that is immediately classified at the boundary, or use the established typed parse-failure channel; the successful path returns the refined value that flows inward to Service Modules and Domain Modules.

Prefer:

```ts
async function handle(body: unknown): Promise<Result<Response, CreateUserError>> {
  const input = CreateUserInput.parse(body);
  if (input._tag === "err") {
    return input;
  }

  return users.create(input.value);
}
```

Avoid:

```ts
async function handle(body: any) {
  return users.create(body); // untrusted data enters service logic
}
```

Avoid validation that discards knowledge:

```ts
CreateUserSchema.parse(body);
return users.create(body); // still the unrefined value
```

## No serialized trust casts

Avoid:

```ts
const input = JSON.parse(text) as CreateUserInput;
const user = await response.json() as User;
const row = record as Invoice;
```

Prefer:

```ts
const raw: unknown = JSON.parse(text);
const input = CreateUserInput.parse(raw);
```

A cast after parsing can be acceptable for branding internals when TypeScript cannot express the invariant, but it needs a local `SAFETY:` explanation and must not leak to callers.

## Concrete parsers, not shared shape guards

Do not export generic utilities like:

```ts
isRecord(value): value is Record<string, unknown>;
isObject(value): value is object;
isArray(value): value is unknown[];
```

They usually mean untrusted values are flowing too far inward. Use concrete parsers:

```ts
const input = CreateUserInput.parse(body);
```

Local `Array.isArray` or object checks are fine inside concrete parser/schema-adapter implementations.

## Strict command objects

Mutating command/request parsers should reject unknown fields so misspellings and obsolete fields fail loudly:

```ts
const CreateUserBody = z.strictObject({
  email: EmailAddressSchema,
  role: RoleSchema,
});
```

Use permissive shapes only for explicitly extensible sub-objects, such as third-party metadata.

## Persistence boundary parsing

Treat inferred storage DTOs as infrastructure facts, not domain proof:

```ts
type InvoiceRow = typeof invoices.$inferSelect;

function parseInvoiceRow(row: InvoiceRow): Result<Invoice, InvalidStoredInvoice> {
  // reject impossible combinations; reconstruct domain values
}
```

Reject contradictory persisted states. Do not silently normalize an impossible row such as `state = "open"` with a non-null `completedAt`.

Treat the persisted discriminator and version as authority. Decode only an exact supported representation. A catch-all branch, default member, or fallback to the newest shape can reinterpret stored data after deployment and hide a required migration.

Use schema-inferred row/insert/update DTOs where the storage library supports them, but parse rows before service logic sees them.

### Decode, then reshape

Use the smallest mapping mechanism that preserves type evidence:

1. **Same shape:** decode with the owning domain schema; add no mapper.
2. **Structural mismatch with domain-ready fields:** decode a fully refined `Stored<Entity>Row`, then use a pure `<entity>FromStoredRow` mapper.
3. **Individual field conversion:** put the field codec in the stored representation schema; keep the outer mapper pure.
4. **Required reverse representation:** use a focused bidirectional codec for that representation.
5. **Cross-field invariant not proved by the stored schema:** use a decode-only transform or a final domain decode.

```ts
const StoredWorkspaceRow = Schema.Struct({
  id: WorkspaceId,
  name: WorkspaceName,
  state: WorkspaceState,
  created_at: Schema.DateTimeUtcFromString,
})

type StoredWorkspaceRow = typeof StoredWorkspaceRow.Type

const workspaceFromStoredRow = (
  storedWorkspaceRow: StoredWorkspaceRow,
): Workspace => ({
  id: storedWorkspaceRow.id,
  name: storedWorkspaceRow.name,
  state: storedWorkspaceRow.state,
  createdAt: storedWorkspaceRow.created_at,
})
```

The decoder establishes brands, refinements, dates, discriminators, and other boundary evidence. The mapper only renames, groups, nests, or constructs values from that evidence. It does not brand raw primitives, apply policy defaults, discard malformed members, or silently normalize invalid state.

Prefer staged decoding over a large representation-to-domain transform. A transform must represent a real conversion or establish a cross-field invariant, not merely rename or nest fields.

## Runtime and serialization boundaries

Values crossing process, runtime, RPC, queue, workflow, Worker/DO/Agent, or structured-clone boundaries must be serializable for that transport.

Do not send rich local objects unless the transport explicitly preserves them:

- class instances;
- custom errors;
- value classes;
- functions;
- database handles;
- request-local objects;
- prototypes/private state.

Use explicit DTOs/codecs and parse on the receiving side:

```txt
Domain value -> protocol DTO -> runtime hop -> parse DTO -> local domain value
```

This applies to result and error values too.

## Protocol and persistence projections

Own each projection at its boundary:

```ts
UserHttp.toPublicJson(user);
UserStorage.toRow(user);
UserQueue.encodeUserCreated(event);
```

Avoid Domain Modules exporting HTTP response policy or persistence column shapes. Domain Modules may expose neutral deconstruction/accessor helpers and domain formatting, but External Adapter Modules own their consumer-specific protocol and persistence shapes.

Do not reuse an HTTP JSON response as a database row merely because both are serializable.

## Config parsing

Parse environment/runtime config once at startup or composition:

```ts
type AppConfig = {
  readonly databaseUrl: Url;
  readonly apiToken: Redacted<string>;
};
```

Avoid reading `process.env` or platform env bindings throughout the app. Missing/invalid config is a startup defect with safe diagnostic context.

## Rejected framings

- **"TypeScript says the row is typed."** Storage types describe database shape, not domain validity.
- **"JSON.parse as T is fine inside a trusted system."** Serialized data loses runtime proof.
- **"We validated it already."** If the refined value is not what flows inward, the parse did not help.
- **"DTOs are domain models."** DTOs are boundary representations.
- **"Generic isRecord helpers are harmless."** They usually spread boundary uncertainty inward.

## Review checklist

Use this as the final scan after applying the rules above; the rule source of truth remains in the relevant sections.

- Typing request bodies as `any` for convenience.
- Casting `Response.json()` output to an app type.
- Passing Prisma/ORM rows directly to Service Modules.
- Falling back to a default model for an unknown persisted discriminator or version.
- Reusing public API JSON as persistence records.
- Accepting unknown fields in mutating commands by default.
- Parsing config in many modules instead of one composition seam.
- Sending custom error/class instances across runtime boundaries without codecs.
